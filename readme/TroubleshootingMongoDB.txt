Troubleshooting

MongoDB won't start
Check that there is at least 3GB space available for its journal files, otherwise mongodb can fail to start (without issuing a message to the user).
$ df -h /var/lib/mongodb/
Check if the lock file exists
# ls  -lisa /var/lib/mongodb
If it does, stop the mongodb service, and delete the file. Then start the service again.
# rm /var/lib/mongodb/mongod.lock
If it still won't start, run a repair on the database, specifying the dbpath (/var/lib/mongodb/ is the default --dbpath in Arch Linux)
# mongod --dbpath /var/lib/mongodb/ --repair
After running the repair as root, the files got chowned to root, whilst Arch Linux runs it under a different user. You then need to chown back the files. Further reference
# chown -R mongodb: /var/{log,lib}/mongodb/
Check that the boost-libs package is up to date. MongoDB requires a specific version, however, the package does not restrict the version of this dependency.
