//Features:

//Bug fixes:

//Improvements:
Redirect to new entity page if current item is deleted
Add additional colors and icons

//Technical depths:
Optimize watches (cache entity 'DisplayName', introduce entity Timestamp or use Created and Modified date and watch it instead of Entity)
Get rid of scope by using controller as (and make it private in FieldControllers)
Replace hard-coded dependencies with angular constants (http://twofuckingdevelopers.com/2014/06/angularjs-best-practices-001-constants/)

//Future feature:
Roles and permissions
Soft delete functionality
Logout
Multi-relationship control
Settings page
Entity create and modify date in filter
Aggregate functions (sum, average, -custom-fn-, etc ...) to summarize list results
